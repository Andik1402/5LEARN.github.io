            Five restaurant reviews
            </h5>
            <p>
            Barry G: We stopped at the White Horse Inn for lunch during a long
            journey. My wife ordered the lasagne and I ordered a steak and ale
            pie. We waited over thirty minutes for our food, and when my pie
            arrived, it was chicken and mushroom. When they brought the correct
            pie, I picked up the gravy and found that it was completely cold. When
            I went to the bar and asked for it to be heated and suggested that we
            should get a partial refund, the barman swore under his breath. When I
            finally started eating, my wife had already finished her meal. Avoid
            this restaurant at all costs!
            </p>
            <p>
            Emma1987: We decided to come here for our Sunday lunch. The prices
            were a bit steep, but we thought it would be worth it, if the food was
            good. Sadly, we were disappointed. Our sausages were burnt and so dry
            that we couldn’t even cut them. My partner’s steak was even worse. It
            certainly wasn’t worth the money. It wasn’t even a pleasant place to
            spend a Sunday. The carpet was old-fashioned and worn, the chairs were
            uncomfortable and the walls needed painting. Very disappointing.
            </p>
            <p>
            PGRigby: We were passing by and felt hungry, so we decided to stop
            here for a meal. We got a warm welcome and were impressed with the
            wide selection of beers and the extensive menu. The dishes are mostly
            traditional, and not very adventurous or exotic, but it was decent,
            reasonably priced, warm and well presented. We were served quickly,
            considering there were seven of us, and the staff were polite.
            Overall, it was good value for money and I would definitely go there
            again.
            </p>
            <p>
            SunnyDay: The pub looked very attractive from the outside, with a
            large car park, disabled access and an attractive garden. It’s in a
            good location on the main road, and I imagine it attracts a lot of
            passing trade. However, if I was local to the area, I wouldn’t come
            here regularly. Although the prices were typical, we didn’t get very
            much for our money. My garlic mushrooms were just that, three small
            mushrooms with a little dry salad – the kind you get from a bag – on
            the side. Then, my partner and I both ordered fish and chips, and my
            fish was much smaller than hers. When we complained, we weren’t
            offered a refund or a new piece of fish. I’m sure there are better
            places to eat in the area.
            </p>
            <p>
            Andrew_Rose: We ended up at the White Horse Inn for our Sunday lunch
            when the pub we planned to eat at had forgotten to note down our
            booking. However, we felt very pleased about this error in the end. We
            were greeted by a friendly, helpful young lady behind the bar who
            allowed us to sample a few of the beers before we made our choices. I
            ordered fish and chips. The fish was fresh and served in a lovely,
            crisp batter. My friends were very happy with their roast dinners. The
            desserts were also delicious. However, for me, it was the excellent
            service and friendliness of all the staff that made the visit stand
            out. We will look forward to returning in the future.
