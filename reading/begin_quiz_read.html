        <h5>How my life has changed</h5>
        <p>
          I used to work on cruise ships as a musician. I travelled a lot! I
          spent the month before the first lockdown in four continents! I used
          to get up really early, drive to the airport and fly to a port across
          the world and get on a ship just to get to work! Then I used to spend
          between three and fourteen days on the ship. The ships were great. The
          food was excellent, and the staff were brilliant. The ship stopped at
          fantastic places, and I often used to spend the afternoon at the beach
          drinking cocktails or sightseeing. But there were disadvantages too. I
          often didn’t know anyone on the ship. But the passengers all knew me,
          and they used to talk to me every time I left my cabin. I didn’t have
          any privacy. Of course, I had to chat to them politely even when I
          wasn’t in the mood.
        </p>
        <p>
          But now, everything has changed. The cruises aren’t running now, and I
          don’t know when they will run again, and I’ve been in my flat for a
          year. I never used to spend much time here, and I haven’t spent a
          whole year in England for over twenty years! But I’ve enjoyed it. I
          bought a bike last year, and I’ve found some great beach cafes that I
          never used to know about. I also bought a campervan, and I drove
          around the coast. I always used to prefer beaches in the Caribbean and
          the Mediterranean to British beaches. The weather is much better for a
          start! But I found some beautiful places last year. I could park on
          the beach in some places and run straight into the sea! They were much
          less touristy and more peaceful than the places where the cruise ships
          go.
        </p>
        <p>
          // I’m spending a lot more time alone now. I didn’t use to be alone
          much when I was working. But since the pandemic started, I have
          developed new relationships with people who I didn’t use to know very
          well. I always used to prefer the company of entertainers and people
          who like to travel. I used to think that people with normal jobs were
          boring. But since last year, I’ve got to know some really interesting,
          strong, kind and caring people! So that’s been really valuable.
