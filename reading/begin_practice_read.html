              Going to the Mall
            </h5>
            <p>
              Every city in the USA has a mall or four. There are about 1,100
              malls in the US. These giant store-filled buildings are one of
              America’s greatest entertainment options for teens and families.
            </p>
            <p>
              Mall of America in Minnesota is the largest mall. It is so big
              that it has an amusement park in it, Nickelodeon Universe, with
              several roller coasters! There are more than 500 stores in it,
              about 400,000m2 and about 12,000 people work there.
            </p>
            <p>
              // But malls nowadays aren’t the same as they used to be in the
              80s and 90s. During those decades, teens would go to the mall and
              spend hours shopping, playing video games at the arcade, or just
              hanging out with friends. It was cool in the summer and warm in
              the winter. In those days, malls provided the perfect source of
              shopping and entertainment for entire families.
            </p>
            <p>
              Nowadays, you can still eat in the food court and go to the
              movies, but there aren’t many arcades left. Millennials have their
              Xboxes or Ps4s, and they like shopping online, which is also
              happening with more and more people from other generations. And as
              more people shop online and play video games at home, fewer people
              go to the mall to hang out.
            </p>
            <p>
              Hopefully, malls will remain one of the great American pastimes.
              But only time will tell how people in the future will prefer to
              spend their time.
